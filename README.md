# etch-a-sketch

This is going to an etch-a-sketch program

Going off of instruction from odin project:

create divs with JS not with HTML.

I have a VERY simple etch-a-sketch program here. 

I have made a nested for loop that creates a grid of div elements

Then for every div element with the class box, I added a background color to the div element when the mouseenter event triggers.

I added a clear button and change color selector, outside of the nested for loop.

Clear button and color button select all the elements with
the box class. Then either changes the background color to white for clear, or a different color for the color selector.
